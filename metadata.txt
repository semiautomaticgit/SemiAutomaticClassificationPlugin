qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description= Plugin for the semi-automatic supervised classification designed to expedite the processing of multispectral or hyperspectral remote sensing images, which provides a set of tools for pre processing and post processing. 
version=3.0.6
about=Written by Luca Congedo, the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) allows for the semi-automatic supervised classification of remote sensing images, providing tools to expedite the creation of ROIs (training areas) through region growing or multiple ROI creation. The spectral signatures of training areas can be automatically calculated and displayed in a spectral signature plot. It is possible to import spectral signatures from external sources. Also, a tool allows for the selection and download of spectral signatures from the USGS Spectral Library (http://speclab.cr.usgs.gov/spectral-lib.html). Several tools are available for the pre processing phase (image clipping, Landsat conversion to reflectance), the classification process (Minimum Distance, Maximum Likelihood, Spectral Angle Mapping algorithms, and classification previews), and the post processing phase (conversion to vector, accuracy assessment, land cover change, classification report). This plugin requires the installation of GDAL, OGR, Numpy, SciPy and Matplotlib. Also, a virtual machine is available http://fromgistors.blogspot.com/p/semi-automatic-os.html .

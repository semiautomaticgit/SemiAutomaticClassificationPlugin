version=7.8.20
about=Developed by Luca Congedo, the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) allows for the supervised classification of remote sensing images, providing tools for the download, the preprocessing and postprocessing of images. Search and download is available for ASTER, GOES, Landsat, MODIS, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 images. Several algorithms are available for the land cover classification. This plugin requires the installation of GDAL, OGR, Numpy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. Some tools require also the installation of SNAP (ESA Sentinel Application Platform).

	- added the iteration of calculations over dates (format yyyy-mm-dd) of band sets entering in the first line forbsdates e.g. forbsdates[2020-01-01:2020-03-30] for iterating over a range or forbsdates[2020-02-01,2020-03-11,2020-04-21] for iterating selected dates, also list of ranges such as forbsdates[2010-01-01:2010-03-30, 2010-08-01:2010-08-31, 2010-10-01:2010-12-31]; it is possible to enter a string after ] to filter names of first band in band set
	- added the iteration of bands in a band set or a range of band sets entering in the first line forbandsinbandset (e.g. forbandsinbandset[1] for iterating over bands in the first band set) and in the following expression the variable #BAND# to refer to the iterated band (e.g. where("#BAND#">1, 1, 2) @"#BAND#")

	- added table filter for band names
	- added the possibility to enter !function! followed by an expression of Batch to execute a function using raster names (also previous output names) in the command and the variables !directory! and !file! to refer to the output directory (defined after Run) and relative output file name (defined with @ after the command) respectively e.g. !function!  stack_raster_bands;band_set : 1;output_raster_path : '!directory!' ; it is required to use section character $ instead of apostrophe ' and !! instead of ; for functions ' e.g. !function! add_raster!!input_raster_name : $#NIR#$!!band_set : 1
	- added the option to select output raster type as Float32, Int32, Int16, UInt32, UInt16, Byte
	- added settings for output nodata value
	- added settings for scale and offset values directly in the output .tif file

	- added function qgis_processing to access QGIS Processing tools (e.g. qgis_processing;command : 'grass7:v.dissolve';parameters : 'input': 'input_path', 'column': 'cat','output': 'output_path')
	- added function !for_directory_in! to iterate commands for all the directories in a directory path (e.g. !for_directory_in!;'directoryPath') with the variables !directory_name! to use the current directory name and !directory! to use the current directory path. The commands are performed in batch until the command !end_for_directory! . Optionally a directory level and a name filter can be set (e.g. !for_directory_in!;'directoryPath';2;'name'). Multiple name filters can be set with | (e.g. !for_directory_in!;'directoryPath';2;'name1|name2'). It is possible to filter by date if the name ends with the date format yyyy-mm-dd using a range (e.g. 2020-01-01:2020-03-31)
	- added function !for_file_in!;directoryPath to iterate commands for all the files (calling !file! in a command) in a directoryPath until !end_for_file! .

It is possible to filter by date if the name ends with the date format yyyy-mm-dd using a range (e.g. 2020-01-01:2020-03-31). Also !file_directory! can be used to refer to the parent directory of the file
	- added function '!start_for_band_set!';bandsetNumber to iterate commands for all the band sets (calling '!band_set!' in a command) until !end_for_band_set! .

(replacing # with a number or string e.g. !temp_raster_1!) to create a temporary raster to be used with other functions such as band_calc;expression : '"raster1"';output_raster_path : '!temp_raster_1!'. !temp_raster_1! replaces the path to the raster and temp_raster_1 is the actual name of the raster
	- added the possibility to create custom variables entering a line such as !customName! = value (value can be either number or text), for instance !number! = 20, this variable !number! will be replaced in the following parts of the batch script
	- added the function remove_band_from_bandset to remove bands from a band set (e.g. remove_band_from_bandset;band_set : 1;band_list : '1, 2')
	- the function to create band set accepts a directory and a file name filter as raster_path_list option (e.g. '/dir, tif')
